Philosophical cybernetics (or phinetics) is the study of philosophical issues using methods and tools from computer science. 

Also see [Why call it "Philosophical Cybernetics"?](name.html)



## Themes

Below are the type of questions phinetics works on. 

### Epistemology

* What is the source and nature of *knowledge* in computer science? Is it documentation or Stackoverflow? 

### Intellectual Property 

* To what extent can ideas and computer programs be fairly owned? 

* To what extent does current intellectual property law and ideology apply to computer programs? 

* In what ways does traditional intellectual property ideology apply to computer entities? 

* Given a certain epistemology of computer science, what intellectual property principles can we derive from it? 

### Metaphysics

* Are computer programs intangible abstract entities or are they concrete physical things? 

### [Tackling Traditional Philosophical Isssues](traditional-philosophical-problems.html)

* How can programming languages be used to **model** traditional philosophical problems?

### Digital Identity 

* What is digital identity? Is it the physical *me* or an autonomous extension of it? 

* Does my virtual counterpart (i.e. my Facebook, Twitter, or blogger self) and its concomitant data have the same rights as the physical me?

### Ethics: A Deontology of computer science 

* How do we create systems capable of moral reasoning? 

* Are computers and robots morally responsible for their actions? 

### Phinetics techniques

* How can computers be used to conduct all the above enquiries?
