Philosophical cybernetics (or phinetics) is the study of philosophical issues using methods and tools from computer science. 

Also see [Why call it "Philosophical Cybernetics"?](name.html)



## Themes

Below are the type of questions phinetics works on. 

### Epistemology

* What is the source and nature of *knowledge* in computer science? Is it documentation or Stackoverflow? 

### Intellectual Property 

* To what extent can ideas and computer programs be fairly owned? 

* To what extent does current intellectual property law and ideology apply to computer programs? 

* In what ways does traditional intellectual property ideology apply to computer entities? 

* Given a certain epistemology of computer science, what intellectual property principles can we derive from it? 

### Metaphysics

* Are computer programs intangible abstract entities or are they concrete physical things? 

### [Tackling Traditional Philosophical Isssues](traditional-philosophical-problems.html)

* How can programming languages be used to **model** traditional philosophical problems?

### Digital Identity 

* What is digital identity? Is it the physical *me* or an autonomous extension of it? 

* Does my virtual counterpart (i.e. my Facebook, Twitter, or blogger self) and its concomitant data have the same rights as the physical me?

### Ethics: A Deontology of computer science 

* How do we create systems capable of moral reasoning? 

* Are computers and robots morally responsible for their actions? 

### Autonomous Machines

* Can software possess autonomy?

* Is autonomy a subjective or objective quality? 

* Is there a need to change our definition of autonomy?

### Memetics: replication and curation

* How can the intellectual framework of memetics be applied to understand modern information technology?

#### Economics and Heteromation

* Is there an unexplained interdependence between technology and economics (which we are only slowly uncovering)?

* Assuming the diffusion of connected technology continues to accelerate at the current rate, is economics the thread that interweaves humans and autonomous machines?

* Which conclusions on the evolution of technology may be drawn from such a premise?

### Phinetics techniques

* How can computers be used to conduct all the above enquiries?
