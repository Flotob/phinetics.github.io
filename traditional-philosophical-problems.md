##Can we make a computer that can solve philosophical problems? 
Yes, trivially: in the same way that we can make a computer that solves mathematical problems. A computer can solve mathematical problems only because we are able to model numbers, arithmetic, functions, etc. in it. If we can model “the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence” inside a computer, it’ll be easy to have the computer solve any associated problems. The challenge lies in the modelling: in fact, objections to philosophical arguments are based on the other philosopher’s model of reality.
