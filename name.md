title: Why call the field "Philosophical Cybernetics"
---

Cybernetics is

> the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things.


-- [Oxford Dictionary of English](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/cybernetics)

Cybernetic comprehensively describes the different types of machinery and concepts we are interested in. We are naturally interested in computers, understood as laptops, desktop computers, or mainframes, *as well as* other machines in which they play a part, such as robots, drones, or self-driving cars.


Our field naturally has clear overlaps with a variety of fields, such as

* computer science
* philosophy
* philosophy of computer science
* philosophy of mathematics
* philosophy of technology

inasmuch as subject matter and research themes are concerned, but philosophical cybernetics also tends to uses computer-based problem-solving methodologies.

Additionally, while the output of the above fields tends to be essentially academic in terms of its nature, philosophical cybernetics should be made by and be intelligible at least to regular practitioners of computer science, if not the wider public.
